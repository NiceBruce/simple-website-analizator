### **This project is an analysis of sites for SEO optimization.**

* First you have to enter the name of the site (you can also specify the port) on the main page **/**, 
* then you will be moved to the page **/urls**, where you will notice the site you entered.
* You can create checks on each added site.
* Check is parsing the HTML body of the site. After checking, you can see the response code and a list of HTML tag values.
* After all the checks, the page with all sites **/urls** will display the dates of the last checks and the response code.
